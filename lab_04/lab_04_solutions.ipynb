    "Python as a language and computing environment is very convenient as it has very simple and natural syntax and supports interactive work within a Python shell or other environment such as Jupyter notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Dynamic typing\n",
    "\n",
    "A language has dynamic typing when it does not force a user to specify types of variables by hand. Instead, a language with dynamic typing will dynamically infer a type of a variable when it has to access it.\n",
    "This makes writing code much easier and facilitates interactivity, but it also means that Python (and similar languages such as R) are much slower than (usually compiled) languages such as C/C++ which have static typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static typing\n",
    "\n",
    "Static typing means that a user has to specify types of all variables when they define it. It allows code to be compiled which can it much faster as there is no need to do dynamic type inference all the time. However, it also means that there is an extra compilation step and hence interactive programming is impossible (or at least much more problematic).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem of scientific computing\n",
    "\n",
    "In scientific computing we need to have both ease-of-use of a dynamic language like Python (since we do not want to force scientists to be full-fledged software engineers) as well as performance provided by compiled languages with static typing such as C/C++.\n",
