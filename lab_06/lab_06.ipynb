    "# Pandas | Core concepts, types and methods\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will carefully develop proper and in-depth understanding of core concepts, types (classes) and methods provided by Pandas.\n",
    "They will be discussed with respect to Numpy in order to facilitate understanding of what typical usecases of both packages are as well as what\n",
    "are their strong and weak points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is focused around two main data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Series` : a one-dimensional sequence of values with a fixed data type.\n",
    "* `DataFrame` : a two-dimensional rectangular table of values with rows and columns. Each column has to be of fixed data type as it is represented as `Series` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, Pandas provides more data structures, but they are useful in rather specific circumstances so we will not discuss them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is internally based on Numpy and its types such as `Series` and `DataFrame` are to a large extent compatible with many Numpy functions.\n",
    "However, there are also very important differences between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial difference concerns the way axes and their indexes are designed which also means that the notion of broadcasting in Pandas is completely different.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Numpy indexes of axes are defined **implicitly** by the fact that elements are arranged sequentially, so they can be assigned with integer coordinates\n",
    "ranging from $0$ to $n-1$ where $n$ is the number elements along a given axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pandas the way indexes work is entirely different. Here indexes are **explicit**, they exist as separate Python objects, and are defined as sets of labels (or even multilevel hierarchies of labels)\n",
    "for elements along a given axis. Therefore, the rules of broadcasting in Pandas are not determined by conformability of shapes of arrays like in Numpy, but by alignment (congruence) of labels.\n",
    "We will discuss the details of broadcasting and alignment in Pandas while discussing `Series` and `DataFrame` types.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many great resources about Pandas can be found in the official documentation. In particular, it is recommended to read the following articles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [10 minutes to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html)\n",
    "* [Essential basic functionality](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/basics.html)\n",
